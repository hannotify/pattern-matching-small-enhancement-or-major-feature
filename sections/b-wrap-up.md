## Pattern matching...

- is a rich feature arc that will play out over several versions.
- allows us to use type patterns in instanceof. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- improves switch expressions. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- makes destructuring objects as easy as (and more similar to) constructing them.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- holds the potential to simplify and streamline much of the code we write today.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

note:
Pattern matching is a rich feature arc that will play out over several versions.
(slide) The first installment allows us to use type patterns in instanceof, which reduces the
ceremony of such code, and the second installment brought us (slide) patterns in switch.
Deconstruction patterns on records are also now available, and more related features will appear in the near future (slide) with the aim of making destructuring objects as easy as - and more similar to - constructing them.

Together with the related features of records and sealed classes (slide), pattern matching holds the potential to simplify and streamline much of the code we write today.

## Major Feature <!-- .element: class="stroke" -->

note:
And that is why we think pattern matching is not a Small Enhancement, but a Major Feature.

### How would you use pattern matching in your work?

Note: We are very curious what your thoughs are about pattern matching.
How you would use pattern matching in your day-to-day work?
Let's discuss that with a drink!
